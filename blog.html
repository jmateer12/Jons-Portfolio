                <p class="blogtext">The topic of CPUs are very important to computers as at the heart they are computers in and of themselves, but at a more basic level what really are they?  To put it simply a CPU which stands for Central Processing Unit is the brains of the computer it is what's responsible for all the calculations made on a given computer.  A processor or CPU is a very complicated device so let's break it down by explaining some basic terminology.  First let's start with the idea of cores these are sub-processors a given CPU has, so if a CPU has 4 cores then that means inside that processor there are 4 little processors in the chip that perform the workload of that CPU.  These cores divide the workload of computations on the computer to accomplish more in a smaller amount of time and allow for more multitasking abilities in the computer.  This is taken further with the idea of threads which is the idea of breaking down a single core into 2 virtual streams of computations called threads.</p>
