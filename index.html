        <!--A brief paragraph of some things about me-->
        <p id="intro">Hello my name is Jonathan Mateer, I'm originally from Carroll Country maryland.  I'm a Computer Science major here with cognates in software development and general CS.  I'm currently a Junior with an expected graduation year of 2026. Some interesting things about me I'd say are that I build computers for fun, and that I like to rock climb.  I'll try and put a picture or two of computers I've built below, and maybe if I can find one of the rockwall I'll put one of those below as well. Some more things about me are that I used to play basketball, I used to do robotics, and I like to learn a little bit of japanese in my free time.
        </p>
